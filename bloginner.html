            <h1>Breaking the code How did we build our Figma plugin </h1>
            <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how to get
                the
                right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin for
                the
                larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged
                and
                categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to
                build
                this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, ‘Designing voice and tone for error messages.
